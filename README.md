## Description

This project is a adaptive mini quiz game where you are tasked with answering 9 computer engineering questions. It has various features which allow you to save your highscore with the local storage as well as view the highscores in order.

In this walk through, I'll hit play. Once you hit play, the quiz will begin. You'd begin a 9 question multiple choice quiz on the subject of HTML, CSS, and JaveScript. with a simple 4 question option set. Selecting the right answer would have your selected option appear green, while the wrongly selected answer choice would appear red.

Once your quiz is complete, you'll be prompted at the end page to either save your score along with your name to join the leaderboard. Don't worry though! if you aren't comfortable with saving the score you got currently, you also have the option to return to the main menu or view the leaderboards.
